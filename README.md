## Customer Segmentation with Dimension Reduction

**[Customers Dimension Reduction](https://github.com/dawid877/customers_dimension_reduction)**  
Used **R** to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional customer data from an online retail dataset. Applied PCA and FAMD to uncover hidden structure and support segmentation strategies.

## Association Rules for Asthma Behaviors

**[Disease Association Rules](https://github.com/dawid877/disease_association_rules)**  
Applied **association rule mining** in **R** to explore frequent symptom and behavior combinations among individuals diagnosed with asthma. Derived health-related insights from binary features.

## Titanic Survival Prediction

**[Titanic Logistic Regression](https://github.com/dawid877/Titanic_Logistic_Regression)**  
Used **Python** and scikit-learn to build a logistic regression model that predicts Titanic passengers' survival. Includes cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability techniques.

## Bachelor's Thesis on Bitcoin

**[My Bitcoin Paper](https://github.com/dawid877/My_Bitcoin_Paper)**  
My academic thesis (PDF, in Polish) focused on evaluating **Bitcoin** as a potential alternative to fiat currencies by analyzing its ability to fulfill the core functions of money.  
Includes an abstract and full 50-page paper.
